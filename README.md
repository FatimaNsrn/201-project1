📊 Model Performance Comparison

This repository documents the development and comparison of four distinct modeling approaches for Binary Sentiment Classification (Positive/Negative) on a large corpus of IMDb movie reviews. We benchmark Traditional Machine Learning (ML) models against Modern Deep Learning (DL) architectures to determine the optimal balance of performance, complexity, and computational cost.

🥇 Final Test Results Summary

The performance of all four primary models is summarized below, based on their final test set evaluation.
